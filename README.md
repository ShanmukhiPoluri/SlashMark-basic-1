Weather Data Analysis

In this repo I have analysed the weather using a dataset "weather.csv" .You can get this dataset in kaggle or any other resources.

The libraries I have used are:

1. pandas - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
2. matplotlib - Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python used for creating high-quality visualizations and graphs.
3. seaborn - Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.
4. scikit-learn - Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn is a python library to implement machine learning models and statistical modelling.

The process:

1. Install all the required libraries.
2. We can use any IDE to perform the operations in my case I have used PyCharm.
3. import all the libraries which are required and used in this prediction.
4. Ensure there is a proper dataset.
5. Read the dataset.
6. If there are any improper data just use data preprocessing and encoding techniques (if necessary).
7. Later use any model to make predictions in my case I have used Linear Regression.(you can use decision tree or any other models.)
8. For visualization use matplotlib library and seaborn for various graphs of your wish.
9. At last save the file with .py and run using scripy "py weather.py " (it is the name of py file).

The outputs screenshots file is also in the repo please verify.
