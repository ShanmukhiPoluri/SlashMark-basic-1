In this repo I have analysed the weather using a dataset "weather.csv" .You can get this dataset in kaggle or any other resources.

The libraries I have used are:

1. pandas - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
2. matplotlib - Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python used for creating high-quality visualizations and graphs.
3. seaborn - Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.
4. scikit-learn - Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn is a python library to implement machine learning models and statistical modelling.
